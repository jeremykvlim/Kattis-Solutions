# Kattis-Solutions

My solutions for Kattis problems. Solutions are named `"problemname".<languagefilename>`. To find the problem statement, please go to:

`https://nus.kattis.com/problems/"problemname"` or `https://open.kattis.com/problems/"problemname"`

Problems are grouped by [NUS course](https://nus.kattis.com/courses) categorizations and a separate self-practice category for non-NUS course problems:

* Data Structures & Algorithms: CS2040 (Java), CS2040C (C++), CS2040S (Java), IT5003 (Python)

* Competitive Programming: CS3233 (any language of choice)

* Optimization Algorithms: CS4234 (C++/Java/Python)

* Self-practice: C++/Java/Python/Rust

Kattis compiles using `g++ 11` for [C++](https://open.kattis.com/languages/cpp), `Java 11` for [Java](https://open.kattis.com/languages/java), `Python 3.8` for [Python](https://open.kattis.com/languages/python3) and `Rust 1.66` for [Rust](https://open.kattis.com/languages/rust).

Problems have to be solved using base programming language libraries or self-coded structures. External libraries, such as `Boost` for C++, `Apache Commons` for Java, `NumPy` for Python 3 and others are not available. However, you are allowed to attach multiple files in one submission, although I never bothered.
