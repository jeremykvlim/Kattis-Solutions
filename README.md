# Kattis-Solutions

My solutions for Kattis problems. Solutions are named `"problemname".<languagefilename>`. To find the problem statement, please go to:
```

```

These problems are solved without comments because of potential plagiarism. If a student gets flagged for plagiarism, they have to be able to run through the logic of their code and justify how it solves the problem. Commentless solutions dissuade this from happening.

Problems are grouped by [NUS course](https://nus.kattis.com/courses) categorizations and a separate self-practice category:

* Data Structures & Algorithms: CS2040 (Java), CS2040C (C++), CS2040S (Java), IT5003 (Python)

* Competitive Programming: CS3233 (C++)

* Optimization Algorithms: CS4234 (C++/Java/Python)

* Self-practice: C++/Java/Python/Golang/Rust

Kattis compiles using `g++ 11` for [C++](https://open.kattis.com/languages/cpp), `Java 11` for [Java](https://open.kattis.com/languages/java), `Python 3.8` for [Python](https://open.kattis.com/languages/python3), `Rust 1.66` for [Rust](https://open.kattis.com/languages/rust) and `Go 1.20` for [Golang](https://open.kattis.com/languages/go).

Problems have to be solved using base programming language libraries or self-coded structures. External libraries, such as `Boost` for C++, `Apache Commons` for Java, `NumPy` for Python 3 and others are not available. However, you are allowed to attach multiple files in one submission, although I never bothered.
